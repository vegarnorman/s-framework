S
=

The design-oriented Sass microframework for quick and easy web development. Grids, typography, vertical rhythm and other design tools packaged nicely into one tool so you can spend less time planning and more time building. Comes well-documented and ready to roll.

**Warning!** you should *not* use S on its own as it doesn't come with cross-browser CSS rules. Use it with a build system like Grunt or Gulp, and use Autoprefixer to maximize compatibility.
